# üõ† leak-utils: The Eleakxir Data Utility Toolkit

`leak-utils` is a powerful command-line tool built to help you manage, process,
and optimize data leaks for use with the **Eleakxir** search engine. It provides
a suite of utilities for data cleaning, format conversion, and file
manipulation, all designed to ensure your data wells are efficient and
standardized.

`leak-utils` is written in **Go** and leverages **DuckDB** for its
high-performance in-memory processing, ensuring fast and reliable operations on
large datasets.

## üöÄ Features

- **Parquet File Management**: Clean and inspect existing `.parquet` files.
- **Format Conversion**: Seamlessly convert `.csv`, `.txt`, `.json` files into
  the optimized `.parquet` format.
- **Schema Uniformity**: Tools designed to help you standardize and normalize
  your data to align with the
  [Eleakxir data leak normalization rules](./DATALEAKS-NORMALIZATION.md). This
  ensures a consistent schema across all your files, which is crucial for
  efficient searching and consistent results.
- **High Performance**: Built with Go and DuckDB for fast and efficient data
  processing.

### Available Actions

#### `cleanParquet`

Optimizes and cleans an existing Parquet file. This can be used to change
columns, clean rows, ...

See:

```bash
leak-utils cleanParquet --help
```

#### `infoParquet`

Displays metadata and schema information for a given Parquet file. Useful for
inspecting file structure and column types.

#### `csvToParquet`

Converts a `.csv` file into a highly compressed and efficient `.parquet` file.
This is the recommended way to prepare your data for Eleakxir.

#### `mergeFiles`

Merges multiple files (of the same type) into a single, larger file. This is
useful for combining smaller data leaks.

#### `removeUrlSchemeFromUlp`

This utility prevents the colon (`:`) in URL schemes like `https://` from being
mistakenly parsed as a column separator when processing ULP data in flat files
like CSV or TXT.
